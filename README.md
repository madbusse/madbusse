## Hey, GitHub! ⚡

I'm Madeline, and I'm passionate about harnessing AI and technology to build game-changing solutions for top-tier clients. Currently, I'm combining my tech skills with my passion for running (I've done 2 marathons and am currently training for Austin!) by building automation solutions for Nike's integrated media team. 

Featured Projects:

- I started with an [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) design template, customized the JavaScript/HTML/CSS, then used AWS (Route53, S3, CloudFront, Certificate Manager) to host it securely.
