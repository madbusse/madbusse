## Hey, GitHub! ⚡

**I'm Madeline, and I'm passionate about harnessing AI and technology to build game-changing solutions for top-tier clients.** Currently, I work at PMG, a global, digital advertising agency, where I'm combining my tech skills with my passion for running (I've done 2 marathons) by building automation solutions for Nike's integrated media team.
